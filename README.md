# Mock-Census-Report

This project presents a data-driven mock census analysis for a fictional UK town.  
The work simulates how real census data can support government decision-making on public infrastructure, transport planning, and community development.  
Using Python, data visualisation, and statistical inference, the project evaluates population characteristics, housing patterns, employment, and commuting behaviour to form evidence-based recommendations.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The analysis focuses on two planning questions:

1. **What should be built on the town’s unoccupied plot of land?**  
2. **Which sector should receive future infrastructure investment?**

Based on demographic and social indicators, the recommended actions are:

- ✅ Construction of a **train station** to support a significant commuter population  
- ✅ Investment in **general infrastructure**, including waste management, healthcare, and road maintenance, to accommodate projected population growth

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** — data processing and visualisation  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy.stats`  
- **Microsoft Word** — written report compilation

## 📊 Analytical Approach

The project workflow included:

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - removal of missing values  
   - correction of invalid inputs  
   - preparation of population-level variables  

2. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - histograms  
   - bar charts  
   - population pyramids  

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - birth rate and death rate estimation  
   - commuter proportion  
   - migration and net population change  

4. **Inference and Policy Recommendations**  
   - transport pressure  
   - infrastructure sustainability  
   - housing capacity

## 📁 Files Included

- **`report/Mock Census report.pdf`** — full written report with interpretation and recommendations  
- **`notebooks/`** — Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, visualisation, and analysis

## 🧩 Key Insights

- Population growth is driven by **natural increase** and **positive net migration**  
- More than **30%** of residents commute for work or education  
- Housing is **under-utilised**, meaning expansion is not immediately required  
- Birth rates in key age groups indicate **continued future population growth**  
- Infrastructure upgrades are necessary to prevent congestion and pressure on services

## 🌍 Impact

The project demonstrates how census-style datasets can be transformed into actionable planning insights.  
These findings could help a local council anticipate transport needs, resource pressure, and long-term urban development.
