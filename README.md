# Mock-Census-Report

This project presents a data-driven mock census analysis for a fictional UK town. The goal is to simulate how real census data can inform urban planning and government policy decisions.
Using Python, data visualisation, and statistical inference, the project explores population characteristics, housing use, and labour patterns — leading to clear, evidence-based recommendations.

🎯 Project Overview

The project investigates two main planning questions:
	1.	What should be built on the town’s unoccupied plot of land?
	2.	Which sector should receive future infrastructure investment?

By analysing demographic and social data, the study identifies patterns in age distribution, employment, commuting, housing, and fertility to recommend:
	•	The construction of a train station to serve a growing commuter population.
	•	Investment in general infrastructure (waste management, healthcare, and road maintenance) to sustain future population growth.

⸻

🧰 Tools and Libraries
	•	Python (Jupyter Notebook) — Data processing and visualisation
	•	Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats
	•	Microsoft Word — Report compilation and presentation

⸻

📊 Analytical Approach
	1.	Data Cleaning: Removal of missing or invalid values, ensuring accurate variable formats.
	2.	Exploratory Analysis: Visualisation through histograms, bar plots, and population pyramids to reveal demographic structures.
	3.	Statistical Analysis: Computation of birth/death rates, migration patterns, and employment proportions per 100,000 residents.
	4.	Inference: Drawing actionable insights to guide infrastructure and policy recommendations.

📄 File Included
	•	Mock Census report.docx — Full written report and analysis
  •	Full Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis and visualisation

🧩 Key Insights
	•	Population growth is driven by both natural increase and positive migration.
	•	Over 30% of residents commute for work or education — justifying a train station.
	•	Housing capacity is underutilised, indicating no immediate pressure to expand housing stock.
	•	Rising birth rates and active age distribution (20–45) indicate sustained population growth.
	•	Infrastructure investment is critical to manage future congestion, waste, and public service demands.

🌍 Impact

The project highlights how demographic analytics can inform real-world decision making.
By modelling this mock census, local authorities can better anticipate population trends, infrastructure needs, and environmental implications — leading to smarter, sustainable growth.
